## Project Description

One paragraph description of your project. Summarize the following:
* **Problem**: Malware is an omnipresent and relevant issue in network systems everywhere, and the prevention of malicious attacks can be aided with the assistance of machine learning techniques.
* **Why is it important?**: If better, more precise malware detection methods are developed, then we can help prevent potentially disastrous attacks that have the potential to take down critical systems upon which the world operates.
* **Relevance to the course**: Malware detection is a direct application of the material and use cases we've covered in this course.
* **Related Work**: This project will be an extension of the nPrint project, as we will attempt to reproduce the results of that paper and the nPrint Autogluon model.
* **Aim**: To successfully detect malware flows in network traffic, developing a model that can distinguish benign and malicious flows in a traffic dataset with accuracy similar to that as seen in recent literature.

## Data

The dataset comes from the Stratosphere IPS, and it is a a faithful recreation of the original netML malware dataset at the raw network packet level. The dataset totals under 10 GB and can be found at:

## Deliverables

The final deliverables will include:
* A Jupyter notebook containing my model and all relevant code for training, validation, etc. that can be run end-to-end, with some analysis embedded inline
* A project report PDF that summarizes the results of the project and does some deeper analysis of the results, with relevant snippets of code.
